          She became a popular photographer’s model and in 1946 signed a
          short-term contract with Twentieth Century-Fox, taking as her screen
          name Marilyn Monroe. After a few brief appearances in movies made by
          the Fox and Columbia studios, she was again unemployed, and she
          returned to modeling for photographers. Her nude photograph on a
          calendar brought her a role in the film Scudda-Hoo! Scudda-Hay!
          (1948), which was followed by other minor roles.

          In their first runs, Monroe’s 23 movies grossed a total of more than
          $200 million, and her fame surpassed that of any other entertainer of
          her time.
